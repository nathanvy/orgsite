I can be reached via email at [[mailto:n@0x85.org][n@0x85.org]] and I promise I do read everything that gets sent my way.  I do not use PGP and have not for quite some time.  Any keys you might find on the keyservers are either expired, revoked, or impersonators.

I technically have a twitter account but when Elon Musk took over twitter I deleted all my tweets and no longer use it.  Generally I try to avoid "big social" now, because I found that I'm way more productive when I don't get caught on the doom scrolling dopamine treadmill.  But I sometimes grin and bear it because you can't exist professionally these days without a linkedin.

Speaking of which, [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanvy][I have a linkedin]].

I'm [[https://github.com/nathanvy][on GitHub too]].
